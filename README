-------------------------------

Demo:
http://www.hallmark-design.co.uk/newsfeed/

This plugin transforms a simple unordered list of links into a tabbed newsfeed widget, and optionally allows users to add their own feeds.

Features:
* One or multiple news feeds arranged as separate tabs.
* Define default tabs with locked pre-selected feeds as a simple unordered list
* Define individual feed preferences (update frequency, number of items, display style)
* Allows user to create tabs or make completely locked.
* User can add new RSS/Atom feeds and delete unwanted tabs by clicking on the tab close button (if not locked)
* Feed auto-discovery - user can enter a website address and the script will find feeds on the page
* Keyword/phrase searches can be used to generate an aggregate feed tab on the fly (eg: "Cricket")
* User-customisable options to set feed refresh frequency, number of items displayed and feed display style, on a per-feed basis.
* The user's tabs and user preferences are remembered with a cookie.
* Multiple newsfeed widgets per page

Important note:
This plugin makes use of Yahoo Pipes for feed auto-discovery and keyword searches. If you plan on using this plugin on a live site please clone the two Pipes.
